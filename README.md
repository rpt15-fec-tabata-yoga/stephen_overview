# Project Name

> This repo is a clone of the overview module on the Stardew Valley page of Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/). I re-created that module so that it can take in data from the other modules on the page and I have a separate repo where I created a proxy server to render all the modules on one page.

***Tools used:***
 - Server: Node, Express
 - Front-end: React, CSS Grid
 - Back-end: MongoDB
